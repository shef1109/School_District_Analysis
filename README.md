# School_District_Analysis
Module 4

## Summary of Findings
 This analysis was performed to better understand the relationships between student grades in math and reading and the school size, type and spending per student. However, there seems to be a disconnect between each Deliverable in what exactly we are trying to determine. Based on data from Deliverable 5, it is found that average scores do not significantly increase based on budget for each school. We can see the data in our comparison below between our school_type versus school_budget table and our table for average reading and math scores for each school type.

The findings above indicate that there are more relevant factors than budget that decide average student scores. From the data, we can see some increase in math scores in charter schools, but it may be worthwhile to complete a side-by-side analysis of math scores for each school and grade. By performing this additional analysis on specific schools, we may be able to determine if there is data that can skew our results, then taking additional steps to removing/replace outliers from the data.
